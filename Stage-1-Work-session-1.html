    <h1>Basics of the World Wide Web</h1>
    <div>
      <h3>Some "Web jargon" simplified:</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          <b>HTML documents:</b> This is the main type of document on the Web.
          They are what holds the Web together!<br>
          <b>URL's:</b> Think of these as the "addresses" or "names" of your
          documents. You use a URL to refer to a document, like you would<br> use a
          friend's name, to refer to them!<br>
          <b>HTTP:</b> This is the protocol with which different "parts" of the Web
          communicate.<br>
          <b>Web applications:</b> These are what really matter in the end.
          Think of them as the paint that makes a painting, on a white canvas.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>What exactly <em>is</em> the Web?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          The Web is mainly composed of a bunch of HTML documents.
          (HTML stands for <b>H</b><em>yper</em><b>T</b><em>ext</em> <b>M</b><em>arkup
          </em> <b>L</b><em>anguage).</em>
          These HTML documents<br> are "linked" together, and the "links" that connect
          them are called <b>hyperlinks</b>.
          This "linking" is what makes the Web "web-like"!<br>You can link a bunch of
          other documents and files to the HTML documents, but the HTML documents are
          the main building blocks of the Web.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>The major components of the Web</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          <b>You:</b> You type something into your..<br>
          <b>Computer and browser:</b> Your computer is running the web browser that
          you type into. (Examples of browsers are Chrome, Firefox, Safari, you<br>
          know). So, your computer sends your <em>requests</em> (using the protocol
          called HTTP that we mentioned earlier) via the...<br>
          <b>Internet:</b> The requests are sent via the Internet to...<br>
          <b>Servers:</b> The servers respond to your requests by sending back
          <em>files</em>, via the internet, to your computer and browser, delivering
          them to you! <br>("Servers" are basically some other computers sitting
          somewhere else in a closet, <em>hosting</em> files, as opposed to your
          computer that you use to <em>browse</em><br> files.
          Don't let the big words get to you.)
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>HTML - up close and personal!</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          HTML is the core of the Web, but what's it made of? Well, it's made up
          of:<br>
          <b>Text content:</b> This is the writing you see.<br>
          <b>Mark up:</b> This is how this writing is displayed.<br>
          <b>References to other documents:</b> Like references to videos or
          pictures.<br>
          <b>Links to other pages:</b> Which are..well...links to other pages.
          Pretty obvious stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok, let's dive deeper in! So, if you type text in an HTML editor then render
          it, it comes out looking the same, nothing fancy happens.<br> However, if
          you want the typed text to look different, you should use..
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>Mark up</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          HTML mark up is made up of things called <b>tags</b>. A tag is written in
          between a "lesser than" symbol and a "greater than" symbol. Here's an
          example:<br>
          &lt;tag&gt; content &lt;/tag&gt;<br>
          The first tag is called the <em>opening tag</em>, and the last tag is the
          <em>closing tag</em>. The name of the tag is the same both for opening and
          closing, but the name<br> in the closing tag has a slash "/" typed before
          it. The word "content" in the example refers to what you are
          trying to use mark up for. The content can be<br> text, or it can even be
          other tags! The entire thing, meaning the opening tag, content, and the
          closing tag, is referred to as "the element".
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>Different types of tags:</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          <b>The &lt;b&gt; tag:</b>"b" stands for "bold", and that's what it does to
          <b>contents</b> of the element! So, to make the word "contents" appear in
          bold, I typed<br> something like this: &lt;b&gt;contents&lt;/b&gt; . That
          made it become bold!<br>
          <b>The &lt;em&gt; tag:</b>"em" stands for "emphasis". This tag makes content
          <em>italic</em>.
          So, guess what happens if you miss the closing end tag? The mark up<br> that
          the tag performs is implemented for everything that comes after it.
          What do we learn from this? <b>Be careful!</b> Your computer only implements
          <br>what you tell it to do!
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>HTML attributes:</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          Let's represent this as follows:<br>
          &lt;tag ATTR = "value"&gt; content &lt;/tag&gt;<br>
          In this example, we have the opening and closing tags as we've previously
          mentioned, but the tag has an attribute, which in this case has been given
          <br>the name ATTR. Tags can have multiple attributes, and as you can see,
          attributes have values.<br>
          An example of a tag that has an atttrubute is:<br>
          <b>The &lt;a&gt; tag:</b>"a" stands for "anchor". This kind of tag is used to
          make links. An anchor tag looks something like this:<br>
          &lt;a href = "https://www.udacity.com"&gt;education&lt;/a&gt;<br>
          In the above example, <b>href</b> is the attribute, its value is a
          <b>URL</b> which in this case is www.udacity.com , and the <b>content</b>
          is the word "education".<br> If this anchor tag was rendered into HTML, we would
          see the word "education" having become a link, to the URL of the udacity
          website.<br> This is what it would become:
            <span>
              <a href="https://www.udacity.com">education</a>
            </span>.
          Go ahead and click it!<br>
          <b>The &lt;img&gt; tag:</b> "img" stands for image. This is the tag you use to
          make a link to an image, and it looks something like this:<br>
          &lt;img src ="url" alt="text"&gt;<br>
          In this case, the attribute is <b>src</b>, which stands for source, and the
          value of this attribute is a <b>URL</b> to the image you want to show.<br>
          The other attribute in this element is the <b>alt</b> tag, wich stands for
          alternate. The value of the alt is text that gets displayed in case of
          broken requests,<br> such as when the image does not load, or if the
          user is a blind person.
          Note that image tags are <b>void</b> tags. This means that they do not have
          "content"<br> like we've seen in other kinds of tags. Since image tags have
          no "content", hence they also have no closing tag.<br>
          Let's say I wanted to make an image tag for a picture of the Space Needle
          in Seattle, my image tag would look something like this:<br>
          &lt;img src=
          "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4f/Seattle_Space_Needle_Crop.jpg"
          alt = "Seattle Space Needle"&gt; .<br>
          Here's what happens when I render it into HTML:<br>
            <span>
              <img src=
              "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4f/Seattle_Space_Needle_Crop.jpg"
              alt = "Seattle Space Needle">
            </span>.
          Pretty cool stuff!
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>Whitespace</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          When we type several lines of text in an HTML editor, for example, and
          you put multiple spaces or empty lines in the middle of your text, when you
          render<br> it into HTML, the result will be one long line of text. This is
          what is called <b>Whitespace</b>. It can be avoided by using a
          <b>&lt;br&gt; tag</b>, which is a <b>break tag</b><br>. Put those in your text
          in your HTML editor at the points where you want your sentences to break
          (when rendered), and the text will continue on a new line.<br> Here's an
          <br> example <br> of what <br> the &lt;br&gt; tag <br> can do! As you can
          see, the break tag is a <b>void</b> tag, like the image tag. You can also
          start new lines by using the <b>&lt;p&gt; tag</b>, and "p" stand for
          "paragraph".<br> The p tag however is not a void tag, since there is
          content in this "element", and the content is basically the text of the
          paragraph itself.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4> Inline and block elements:</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          Examples of inline elements are &lt;br&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, and
          &lt;img&gt; tags. The reason is that they all just have their effect in
          the middle of the text when rendered<br> into HTML. An example of a block
          element is the &lt;p&gt; tag, since it doesn't just make a break in the
          text to start the following text on a new line like a &lt;br&gt; tag would.
          <br> The &lt;p&gt; tag actually forms something like an invisible box that
          has height and width, and this box contains text in it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>Span and Div elements:</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          <b>Span</b> is an inline element, and <b>Div</b> is a block element. Both
          of them are container elements, since they contain their content.
          Styles can be attached to both of them<br> to adjust how they display their
          content. To show the difference, I will use both the span and div elements
          on identical sentences, as follows:
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>Perhaps one day I will become</span> a successful software developer!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>Perhaps one day I will become</div> a successful software developer!
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          The first sentence shows the effect of the span element on the "Perhaps
          one day I will become" segment of the sentence, while the second sentence
          shows<br> the effect of the div element on the same portion of the sentence.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

      <h3>The composition of websites</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Websites are composed of:<br>
          <b>HTML files</b>: which form the framework or structure of the
          website, like the walls of a house.<br>
          <b>CSS files</b>: which does the styling of the website.<br>
          <b>Javascript files</b>: which are the interactive components of the
          website, that change some of its elements. <br>
          <b>Web tools</b>: which are used to help build websites.<br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>A look at webpage structure</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          When looking at the elements of a webpage, you don't see the actual
          code, but you see the structure of the page. As you move your mouse
          over any given element of the page, the segment of the page which each
          element represents become highlighted. when you click on the triangle
          to the left of an element, it expands, and you can continue going
          deeper into the element until you see the actual text that appears on
          the page. Note that not all elements are actually visible on the page,
          but all elements are rectangular.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is notable that the structure of the page is a <b> tree-like
          structure</b>, and the technical term for this tree-like structure is
          <b>DOM</b>, which stands for <b>Document Object Model</b>.Each
          sideways triangle in this structure is an HTML element. Each one of
          these elements has an opening tag and a closing tag, and the contents
          of each element can be text or can be another element.<br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>HTML-CSS-DOM</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          So, how do these three, meaning HTML, CSS, and DOM work together?
          Well, the web broswer turns HTML tags into elements in a tree, and it
          knows how to do that because of DOM. Each tag has a name or type that
          dfines what kind of element will be created. Also, each tag can have
          attributes with values. The HTML document written defines the
          structure and content of the page, while CSS defines the style. CSS
          allows you to use specific syntax and rules to determine how elements
          look on a page.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Design on webpages</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Every element on a webpage is in a box. Even though some elements may
          <em>look</em> like they have other shapes, such as a circle, but they
          are still actually just boxes. The circle shape is actually just a
          style that is used to display the box as a circle. To see the
          style used to display a particular element, open up developer tools on
          the webpage, highlight the element, and that will display the style
          used for it on the style panel. If you change the style, the way the
          element is displayed immediately changes.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Boxifying design</h3>
      <div>
          <p>
            When presented with a webpage design, a person should draw a box
            around every visual element until there's just one element in each
            box. Then, boxes can be transferred to an HTML document by defining
            each box with a &lt;div&gt; tag, and then putting in some place-holder
            content into each &lt;div&gt;element, to remember which box each tag
            refers to. Then, each tag should be marked to remember to apply
            style to it later, and this is done by giving a <b>class attribute</b>
            to each element. These class attributes are like labels on boxes,
            that remind you what's inside them. HTML tags can belong to multiple
            classes, so each element can be given more than one class attribute.
